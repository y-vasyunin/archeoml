# archEOml
Public dataset for archaeological site detection from Earth Observation imagery through Machine Learning

## To do
- [ ] Define a machine learning problem, come up with a project plan and a database schema
- [ ] Find locations of existing archaeological sites that are visible from public satellite basemaps, such as Google and Bing Maps
- [ ] Set up a data labeling workflow (PostGIS/QGIS)
- [ ] Perform data labeling for 100 sites
- [ ] Release an `archeoml-100` dataset for the defined ML problem
- [ ] Experiment, test, and decide if continue the project:
  - [ ] Collaborate with other researchers to speed up labeling process
  - [ ] Release new dataset versions in steps (e.g., 500, 1000, 2000)
